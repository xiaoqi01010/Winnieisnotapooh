I am still really bad at it so please do feel free to give comments! Your feedbacks will be valued. 
I didnt upload everything in home directory(most of it actually HHH) because there were too many files but the codes run cleanly in my linux system hhh. I can just send the zip file but noone will need it anyways hhh. Please do give comments!
